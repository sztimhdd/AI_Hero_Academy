Cold, concrete fixes (before seeding 50 users Monday)

First 30-second "holy shit" moment is weak right now
Current landing/diagnostic intro is informative but dry ("Before we build your personalised training course...").
→ Change headline to promise ROI: "Cut 2+ Hours/Week on Emails & Reports – Free AI Coach Tailored to Your Job"
→ Sub: "Takes 5 mins to diagnose → Daily 5-min practice → Real results in 7 days."
→ Add 1 testimonial-style teaser (anonymized from your tests): "Saved me 45 mins on client follow-ups – Relationship Manager, RBC"
This turns "nice quiz" into "fix my pain now".

Tool-env branching still invisible in demo
Frames show Copilot/M365-heavy examples (e.g., "in Copilot", "M365 integration"). No clear fork for ChatGPT-only users.
→ Add explicit question early (Q2 or Q3): "Which AI tools do you have access to at work?" with checkboxes (ChatGPT, Copilot in Outlook/Teams, Gemini, None).
→ In coach feedback, show variant prompts: "If using ChatGPT: [prompt A] | If Copilot: [prompt B]". Users must see "this matches my stack" instantly.

Personalization "wow" factor needs amplification
Gap map / skill domains mentioned but not shown clearly in frames (maybe later in video).
→ After diagnostic: force a visual radar chart or bar graph: "Prompting: 45% | Agents: 20% | Analytics: 70%" + "Your biggest gap: Advanced prompting for client comms".
→ Tie directly to goldmine: "Based on 300+ real bank use cases, here's your custom path starting with email rewriting."
