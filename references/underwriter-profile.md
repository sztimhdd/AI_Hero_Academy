# Underwriters – Role Intelligence Profile (EDC)

## 1. ROLE FUNDAMENTALS

*   **role\_prefix:** **uw** (identifies the Underwriter role in systems and course materials)
*   **Official Titles & Variants:** *Underwriter* (primary title). Senior, Principal, and Associate Underwriter roles exist as higher or supporting levels. (Historical “Underwriting Advisor” titles were retired under EDC’s Work Architecture Modernization.) [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Clarke%2c+Samantha), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Lam%2c+Harold) [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Murphy%2c+Andrew), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)
*   **Departments/Business Units:** Underwriters operate across **Insurance & Working Capital Solutions (IWCS)** – e.g. *Small Business (SB) Segment & Partnerships*, *Mid-Market Regional Underwriting (RegUW)* teams – and **Financing** (Corporate Lending) units. Some Underwriters are embedded in risk management (Risk Underwriting within the **Risk Management Office**) for independent credit review. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Sandjo%2c+Laura+Nana), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Tedesco%2c+Francesco)
*   **Reporting Lines:** Typically report to **Underwriting Managers** or **Directors** within their segment. For example, SB and Mid-Market Underwriters report to regional underwriting managers (who in turn report to VPs in the Small Business & Partnerships group). Underwriters supporting corporate lending often report to Financing Directors/Managers. Ultimate escalation can reach the VP level for their domain (e.g., **VP–Insurance & WC Solutions**, **VP–Corporate Lending**).
*   **Approx. Headcount:** *Not found.* (EDC’s enterprise documents list dozens of individuals with the Underwriter title, but no explicit total count is published. The role spans multiple segments and regions.)
*   **Seniority Levels:** Underwriters are tiered by internal grade levels (e.g. **Underwriter 13–14, Underwriter 15–17, Senior Underwriter 18**) with increasing delegated authority. Senior Underwriters handle higher complexity deals and mentor junior UWs. “Associate Underwriters” support frontline UWs on tasks like credit analysis and documentation for smaller deals.

## 2. CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

**1. Evaluate and decision credit limit applications (Credit Insurance):** Review new **credit limit requests** from policyholders for insuring foreign buyer receivables. Analyze buyer creditworthiness (financial statements, payment history, country risk) and assign risk ratings. **Frequency:** Daily; dozens of applications per week in SB/MM segments. **Inputs:** Online applications (via EDC’s portal), internal credit reports, financial statements (sourced via the **COT** info sourcing team), and external credit agency data. **Outputs:** Credit decisions (approve, partial, decline) recorded in the **CIS** system along with rationale. Decisions are communicated to the exporter or broker (often by standardized email templates). **Systems:** CIS/Chinook (application task & buyer file), internal risk rating tools, and EDC’s online **Credit Insurance Portal** (for managing limits). **AI Opportunity:** *Verification and Judgment* – Underwriters must critically verify buyer information and model outputs. Generative AI could assist by quickly summarizing financial data or flagging discrepancies, but human judgment is vital to confirm accuracy.

**2. Conduct due diligence on financing deals (Corporate & Medium/Large Segment):** Perform in-depth credit analysis for new **loan/guarantee transactions**. This includes reviewing borrower financial statements, cash flow projections, industry data, and credit agency ratings. Engage EDC’s Advisory teams (e.g. **KYC/Financial Crimes**, **Environmental & Social (ESG)**, **Economics**, **Technical** assessors) to address flagged risks during pre-screening. **Frequency:** Ongoing; each deal’s due diligence can span days to weeks. **Inputs:** Detailed financial models, customer due diligence results (KYC checks, ESG reviews), legal documentation from clients (term sheets, loan applications, project info). **Outputs:** Comprehensive **Credit Submission** or underwriting memo summarizing the deal, risk assessment, proposed structure and covenants, for approval by credit authorities. **Systems:** *MBC* (Main Banking Center – system of record for credit authorizations), *FACT* (internal system for risk rating & credit models), and *Gemini* (for pre-screening flags like KYC/ESG). **AI Opportunity:** *Tool Fluency (M365 + Copilot)* – Underwriters could use Microsoft Copilot to summarize large financial documents or generate first drafts of credit memos, saving time. They must still apply judgment and verify the outputs (for example, checking that an AI-drafted risk analysis aligns with EDC’s underwriting standards).

**3. Structuring credit solutions and conditions:** Design appropriate **deal structures and risk mitigation measures**. For loans, recommend credit terms (tenor, covenants, collateral, pricing) that meet borrower needs while protecting EDC. For insured credit limits, set conditions like insured percentage, discretionary credit limits, or requiring *Pre-Approved Conditions (PAC)* (standard terms for certain risks). Ensure compliance with EDC’s policies (e.g. sovereign limits, industry restrictions, Delegation of Authority) when structuring deals. **Frequency:** Built into every transaction’s approval process. **Inputs:** EDC’s *Delegation of Authority standards*, product guidelines (e.g. max tenor or coverage limits), and risk assessment findings. **Outputs:** Transaction term sheets or credit approval documents listing key covenants, security requirements, guarantee percentages, fees, and any special conditions. **Systems:** MBC (for recording authorized terms), documentation templates (loan/guarantee agreements), standard clause libraries. **AI Opportunity:** *Prompting for Outcomes* – EDC is exploring AI to suggest optimal structures by analyzing prior similar deals. Underwriters could prompt a Copilot for covenant benchmarks or pricing ranges given risk factors, then fine-tune terms with their expertise. (Opportunity to test *Tool Fluency* and *Prompting* skills; AI must be guided with the right parameters and outputs verified for compliance.)

**4. Documenting credit decisions and file integrity:** Maintain thorough **documentation** in the official credit file. Enter all relevant financial analysis, rationale, conditions, and approvals into the appropriate system and templates. Push buyer *validity dates* and capacity limits in the system whenever a credit is reviewed or renewed. For loans, ensure approved terms are accurately reflected in the **loan documentation** (e.g. facility agreements, guarantees) before signing. **Frequency:** Continuous – for each credit decision and review. **Inputs:** Deal details, analysis, approval outcomes. **Outputs:** Updated records in CIS (for insurance files) and MBC/AMA (for loans), plus **Credit Shell** spreadsheets or Word-based **credit notes** stored in SharePoint repositories. Also, clear internal memos on any deviations or special approvals obtained. **Systems:** CIS/Chinook buyer file (tabs for analysis, comments), MBC and AMA for loan data, SharePoint for supporting docs, **eSignoff Template** for signatory approvals. **AI Opportunity:** *Data Safety and Compliance* – This responsibility tests AI usage boundaries. Underwriters handle sensitive financial and customer data marked *Protected B*, so they **must not** input confidential details into public AI tools. They can, however, use internal AI tools to assist with summarizing or cross-checking information, provided no privacy or confidentiality rules are breached.

**5. Communicating with clients and partners:** Act as a credit subject-matter expert in communications with **external stakeholders**. Underwriters regularly respond to exporters or brokers with decisions, conditions, and rationales – often using standardized email templates for consistency and clarity. They handle inquiries about why a limit was partially approved or declined, requesting additional info for appeals or re-assessments. Underwriters also communicate with **internal client managers** (Account Managers in Business Development or *Customer Care*) to clarify decisions or gather customer insights. In the **guarantees and bonding** business, they interact with Canadian companies’ **banks and sureties**, e.g. discussing risk-sharing or obtaining bank feedback on our terms. **Frequency:** Daily, via email, phone calls, and meetings as needed. **Inputs:** Customer questions (e.g. “Why was my buyer declined?”), internal guidance on messaging (approved phrasing for sensitive topics), latest credit decision data. **Outputs:** Clear stakeholder communications – e.g. a polite declination email citing “full review of the latest available information” and offering the appeal process; or phone discussions with a bank to explain EDC’s guarantee terms. **Systems:** Outlook (emails), Teams/phone for calls, CRM (C3) to log significant customer interactions. **AI Opportunity:** *Prompting for Outcomes* – Underwriters could use a writing assistant to draft client-friendly explanations of credit decisions based on internal guidelines, ensuring the tone is courteous and the message is accurate. They must review AI-drafted text for correctness and confidentiality (avoiding specifics that shouldn’t be disclosed).

**6. Monitoring portfolios and risk triggers:** Perform **ongoing surveillance** of credit exposures and trigger reviews when needed. Underwriters track their portfolio of insured buyers or loans for signs of deterioration or upcoming expiries. For insurance, they conduct **Scheduled Periodic (SPEC) reviews** of higher-risk buyers – e.g. when a buyer’s risk rating worsens or exposures exceed set thresholds. They must initiate extra reviews if a buyer develops problems (e.g., overdue payments, negative news). In lending, underwriters (or designated Asset Managers) carry out **annual Credit Reviews** of loans to update risk ratings and decide if risk mitigation or transfer actions are needed. They also add companies to the **Heightened Monitoring list (HAL)** when risks become elevated, requiring quarterly reviews by 2nd line risk management. **Frequency:** Regular (annual for most loans; varying schedules for insurance buyers – could be quarterly or annual depending on risk criteria) and event-triggered (e.g., immediately upon major negative news). **Inputs:** Financial updates from clients, trade sector news, portfolio monitoring reports (e.g. triggers like rating downgrades, covenant breaches, arrears). **Outputs:** Updated risk assessments and decisions on support (e.g., continue cover, reduce limits, request collateral, or transfer asset to Special Risks). All actions are documented in systems and communicated to affected stakeholders (e.g., advising a policyholder of a limit withdrawal due to buyer deterioration). **Systems:** CIS (for recording buyer reviews and conditions), AMA (for loan review actions), periodic risk reports (e.g., HAL reports, delinquency reports). **AI Opportunity:** *Verification and Judgment* – AI could help by analyzing financial trends and news to flag at-risk accounts faster, but ultimate judgment on credit quality and appropriate action rests with the underwriter. The role demands keen judgment to verify any AI-generated alerts before taking action.

**7. Coordinating approvals and escalations:** Manage the **credit approval workflow** for cases requiring higher authority. Underwriters prepare recommendation packages when a request exceeds their own signing authority or falls outside standard policy. They route these to the correct **approver level** – e.g., a Director, Credit Committee, or even EDC’s Board for the largest exposures. They must anticipate and highlight key issues for approvers (e.g. exceptions to guidelines, unique risks) and sometimes **present the deal** in approval forums such as management credit committees or the **Daily Deal Forum (DDF)** for complex cases. **Frequency:** As needed – routine for larger or unusual deals. **Inputs:** Completed credit analysis, a clear rationale for recommending the risk, any required endorsements (e.g., Risk Management Office sign-off, or Policy exceptions from product teams). **Outputs:** Approved or declined credit decisions at the higher level, often with meeting minutes or approval memos attached. If approved, underwriter incorporates any additional conditions the approver stipulates (e.g., shorter tenor, specific covenants) into the final terms. **Systems:** EDC’s **eSign**/approval workflow for routing approvals, and SharePoint sites for credit committee materials. **AI Opportunity:** *Not applicable* – Escalation is a fundamentally human process requiring consensus-building, judgment, and often discussion of qualitative factors that AI cannot replicate. However, AI might assist in assembling the approval memo by pulling key points from the analysis for the underwriter to refine (with careful human oversight for tone and completeness). [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Murphy%2c+Andrew)

**8. Policy and exception management:** Apply and sometimes challenge EDC’s **credit policies**. Underwriters ensure each transaction conforms to EDC’s Mandate, Risk Appetite limits, and product-specific guidelines. When a desired transaction falls outside standard parameters, the underwriter must identify the *exception* and seek approval from the designated authority – for example, obtaining a management sign-off for a policy profile exception or a pricing deviation. They keep meticulous records of any approved deviations and rationale (e.g., documenting a Manager’s written approval for a special risk acceptance). **Frequency:** Infrequent but critical – only when non-standard terms or high-risk cases arise. **Inputs:** EDC policies/standards (DOA tables, Product Profiles), details of the exception (e.g. buyer rating below minimum, or needed rate below pricing floor), business justification from the front-line. **Outputs:** *Exception request* memos/emails and the resulting decision (approval with conditions or refusal). Underwriters implement approved exceptions with necessary controls (e.g., adding a file note that a normally prohibited country was allowed by SVP decision). **Systems:** Email and SharePoint for tracking approvals; internal policy repositories for reference; **COE Request site** for logging exceptions in some product groups. **AI Opportunity:** *Not applicable* – Navigating policy exceptions is about corporate risk tolerance and case-specific judgment. AI cannot decide on exceptions, though it might one day help by cross-referencing policies – ultimately the human underwriter must exercise careful judgment and seek human approvals. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

*Additional supporting roles:* Throughout these responsibilities, Underwriters collaborate with **supporting roles** like Risk Analysts (second-line RAs who provide independent credit analysis in high-risk insurance cases), **Underwriting Operations (UW Ops)** specialists who handle administrative tasks (e.g. issuing standard documents, managing email queues), and **Regional Policy Coordinators** who assist with policy documentation and customer follow-ups. These roles enable underwriters to focus on core credit decisions by taking on data entry, file maintenance, and customer coordination tasks.

## 3. DAILY AND WEEKLY WORKFLOWS

*   **Typical Monday:** Underwriters usually start the week reviewing new incoming requests and any backlog from the weekend. In Credit Insurance, Monday morning may bring a spike in new limit applications requiring triage and assignment (sometimes handled by a duty underwriter or queue system). Underwriters also check for **urgent items** – e.g. rush requests flagged by the Customer Care Team (CCT) or account managers as urgent shipments. They often attend a **team “huddle” or pipeline meeting** on Monday to coordinate workload and priorities for the week. For corporate deals, Monday may involve updating pipeline status and preparing for any credit committee meetings later in the week.
*   **Weekly Rhythm:** Underwriters’ weeks are driven by **transaction cycles and service SLAs** rather than a strict day-by-day schedule. **Mornings** are often spent on high-priority credit decisions or calls with clients/brokers before overseas time zones end their day. **Afternoons** allow deeper analysis work and internal meetings. A mid-week pattern often emerges: by Tuesday/Wednesday, many credit decisions are being finalized or presented for approval, so early week is heavy on analysis and write-ups. **End-of-week** (Thursday/Friday) might be used for less urgent tasks – updating files, collaborating on process improvements, or clearing any pending reviews. Fridays are also used to wrap up any decisions due that week (to avoid backlogs over the weekend) and to handle administrative tasks like ensuring all newly approved limits are correctly entered into systems.
*   **Recurring Meetings:** Underwriters participate in several recurring forums: **(a)** **Team meetings/huddles** – e.g. daily 15-minute stand-ups or weekly team meetings to distribute work, discuss challenges, and share news on policy or process changes. **(b)** **Credit decision forums** – Underwriters join formal approval meetings when needed, such as the **Daily Deal Forum (DDF)** for complex or boundary-pushing cases, where senior management and stakeholders discuss significant transactions. **(c)** **Triage or pipeline reviews** – in corporate financing, underwriters meet with Business Development (BD) in **Triage Committee** discussions (often weekly) to decide which opportunities proceed to full underwriting and what needs to be done for them. **(d)** **Portfolio review meetings** – e.g., quarterly portfolio or watchlist reviews with Risk Management, where underwriters discuss troubled accounts or sector outlooks (particularly relevant for senior underwriters managing larger portfolios).
*   **Peak Periods:** Workload can be seasonal or cyclical. For instance, in corporate lending the spring months (March–June) see heavier volume of **credit submissions (\~1,000+)**, requiring careful time management and possibly overtime. Underwriters adjust by prioritizing high-impact deals and possibly deferring lower-risk routine reviews in busy periods. In Credit Insurance, peaks occur when large policyholders upload bulk buyer renewal requests or during economic downturns when many buyers deteriorate at once. Underwriters must triage aggressively: focusing on cases with significant exposure or imminent shipments first to meet service targets.
*   **Time-Consuming Activities:** The **analysis and documentation** process is the most time-intensive part of the job. Reviewing financials, writing up credit rationales, and inputting data into multiple systems (often manually) can consume the bulk of an underwriter’s day. Coordinating with multiple internal stakeholders (risk, legal, ESG advisors) for each deal is also a major part of weekly work. For small transactions, the high volume means much of each day is spent in the credit system processing many small limit requests as efficiently as possible, while ensuring accuracy.
*   **Repetitive & Low-Value Tasks:** Underwriters report several administrative tasks that feel repetitive: e.g. re-entering the same data in multiple places (updating the same financial figures in CIS, in a Credit Shell spreadsheet, and in the approval form); copying information from customer emails into internal systems; manually pushing out standardized notices or limit expiry reminders. Email management is a particular pain point – underwriters historically spend significant time manually triaging emails from customers and partners before EDC implemented better tools (like **Emailtopia queues** for sorting messages). These tasks, while necessary for record-keeping and communication, are candidates for automation to free up underwriter time.
*   **End-of-Week Admin:** On Fridays or the last day of the workweek, underwriters often do a “housekeeping” sweep: making sure all accepted offers and approved limits are properly documented and that any required follow-up (like obtaining missing documents or sending out final contracts) is in progress. They check upcoming expirations or client replies due soon, so nothing critical falls through over the weekend. Many use this time to update personal workplans or respond to any outstanding non-urgent queries from earlier in the week.

## 4. TOOLS AND SYSTEMS (COMPREHENSIVE)

**● Microsoft 365 Tools:** Underwriters rely heavily on **Outlook email** for daily communications with customers, brokers, and internal colleagues. They use **Teams** for internal meetings (e.g. quick huddles, calls with BD or Risk, screen-sharing analysis) and chat for real-time collaboration (e.g. pinging a risk analyst about an urgent file). **Word** and **Excel** are used to prepare credit documents: e.g., *Credit Shell* templates in Excel for summarizing financial ratios, and Word for drafting detailed credit memos or Board briefing notes. Many **SharePoint** sites and libraries store underwriting resources – policy manuals, job aids, standard template letters, and product profiles – which underwriters access regularly through their browser or SharePoint-integrated Teams channels. (They also use SharePoint to save and retrieve past credit decisions and trip reports.) Increasingly, underwriters experiment with **M365 Copilot** features (e.g. using it to outline an email reply or summarize a long PDF) but always with caution and post-editing, given confidentiality and accuracy requirements.

**● Credit Insurance Systems:** The core platform is **CIS** (Credit Insurance System), an internal application for managing buyer credit limits and policyholder information. Underwriters use CIS (and its newer interface, **Chinook**) for tasks like creating buyer assessments, inputting financial data, setting risk levels, and recording decisions. CIS triggers workflow events – e.g., when an application is submitted via EDC’s online portal, it appears as a task in CIS for an underwriter to action. Underwriters update **validity dates, aggregate limits,** and **group caps** in CIS whenever they review a buyer, to ensure exposures are current. **Emailtopia** (an email management tool) is linked to CIS; customer replies and additional info often route to “cell” mailboxes that underwriters monitor and clear, with some automation to assign or flag emails based on policy or buyer mentioned. *Other insurance tools:* *InfoSource/COT systems* for pulling external credit reports and financials (e.g. D\&B, S\&P reports) which underwriters request via an internal team (COT). Also, the **Unified Credit Model (UCM)** is a new automation tool to assist underwriters by automatically generating first-draft credit documentation for straightforward cases, using data from buyers and policyholders. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

**● Loan and Guarantee Systems:** For financing transactions, underwriters work in EDC’s deal systems: **MBC** (Main Business Center) is the system of record where they input key deal data and submit transactions for credit authorization. After approval, the credit file moves to **AMA** (Asset Management Application) for ongoing monitoring and any amendments post-signing. Underwriters populate these systems with all relevant details – borrower info, risk ratings, conditions, etc. There are also specialized tools: **FACT** (Financial Analysis & Credit Tool) for credit risk rating and probability of default (PD) model calculations, and **Gemini** (an internal screening platform) that underwriters use at the triage stage to identify required advisory reviews (e.g. triggering ESG, KYC, or Economic analysis if thresholds are met). *Other tools:* *C3* (EDC’s CRM system) captures interactions at the front end – BD enters opportunities into C3, and underwriters may consult those records to see background on the customer and deal (e.g. onboarding status, previous transactions). In Insurance Guarantee products, a system called **Chorus/ChOrder** (internally nicknamed “Chinook” interface) is used to manage bond and guarantee requests and link to the CIS policy data – underwriters ensure access to these applications early in their onboarding.

**● Internal Portals & Knowledge Systems:** Underwriters have a rich set of internal resources. The **Credit Insurance Resource Center** (SharePoint site) hosts guidelines like the *Credit Insurance Risk Assessment Guideline*, product profiles, and process maps. Underwriters use EDC’s intranet (LiveWire) to find the latest policies (e.g. **Delegation of Authority standards** for various products) and job aids (e.g. “Credit Documentation in CIS” job aid, “Managing Overdue Buyers” process guide). They also use the **Insurance Product Management** site for exception logs and custom clause repositories – e.g. a centralized log of all policy exceptions approved, which is monitored by a Center of Expertise. For corporate deals, underwriters reference the **Financing Guidelines and Procedures** (like the *Financing Line of Business Underwriting Procedure*) often available on the intranet or SharePoint.

**● Data & Reporting Tools:** Underwriters and their managers track performance and portfolio metrics using internal reports. The **Credit Insurance Underwriting (CIU) Dashboard** tracks service level performance (e.g. percentage of limit decisions within SLA). Underwriters in Small Business and Mid-Market teams are expected to maintain high responsiveness (for example, a target of X% of new limit requests decided within 3 business days) – these metrics are reported by management regularly. They also have access to risk and portfolio reports via **Power BI** (e.g. Buyer Portfolio Risk dashboards showing exposures by risk level and country). For lending, the **Portfolio Performance Report** tracks end-to-end cycle times (like underwriting turnaround) and credit quality metrics (impaired loans, watch-list percentage) to which underwriters contribute. Underwriters may use these reports to identify bottlenecks and to prioritize their work to improve service (e.g., focusing on aged cases). *Pain point:* Historically, the lack of fully integrated systems has made it difficult to get a “single view” of workflow metrics – part of EDC’s digital modernization is aimed at giving underwriters better real-time workflow data so they can manage tasks more efficiently.

**● Other Software:** Underwriters use external financial databases and tools when needed. For example, they may consult **Capital IQ** or Bloomberg for market and industry data on larger borrowers. On the insurance side, they sometimes use credit agency portals (e.g. to pull a Moody’s or S\&P rating, or D\&B report) via the Info Sourcing team. All such external data is typically requested through internal channels (to ensure proper licensing and confidentiality). Some also use general productivity tools – e.g. OneNote for tracking their work, or PowerPoint to prepare slides if they need to present a complex case at a committee. In all cases, underwriters must abide by EDC’s data security policies: only using approved software and ensuring that protected client data is stored on EDC systems or encrypted devices.

## 5. DOCUMENTS AND CONTENT

**A. Documents Underwriters CREATE:**

*   **Credit Approval Submissions (Loan & Guarantee):** A formal credit memo or *credit submission document* that synthesizes the due diligence findings, risk analysis, and proposed loan structure for approval. These range from a few pages for simple deals to extensive memos for complex transactions. *Audience:* Internal approving authorities (Directors, Credit Committee, Board). *Format:* Word document or PDF, often following a template (executive summary, company background, financial analysis, recommended terms, risk mitigants). *Frequency:* Per each significant transaction (could be weekly in busy periods). *Source-of-truth:* The finalized version is stored in EDC’s deal repository (MBC for loans) and attached to the official credit file for record.

*   **Buyer Risk Assessments & Credit Shells (Insurance):** A structured write-up of an individual buyer’s creditworthiness. Underwriters complete a “Credit Shell” (Excel/Word job aid) capturing financial ratios, risk rating rationale, payment experience, and recommended credit limit. They input these details into CIS and sometimes produce a PDF summary. *Audience:* Primarily internal – for future reference and audits; indirectly, informs what is communicated to policyholders. *Format:* Form-based (fields in CIS) plus any attached analysis (e.g., a memo for high-value buyers). *Frequency:* Daily (multiple buyer assessments per day for SB/Mid-Market UWs). *Source-of-truth:* The CIS buyer file. Underwriters ensure all supporting information is documented there (financials, comments, contact notes).

*   **Email & Letter Communications:** Underwriters draft a large volume of outgoing communications. These include **decision notification emails** to customers or brokers – often following templates that cover approval terms, declines, or requests for more information. They also prepare **formal letters** for certain cases (e.g., confirming policy cancellations, responding to appeals, or issuing default notices in loan agreements). *Audience:* External customers (exporters, brokers, partner financial institutions). *Format:* Email (plain language, with standardized phrasing for consistency) or PDF letters on EDC letterhead for official notices. *Frequency:* Daily. *Source-of-truth:* Sent emails are saved in Outlook folders or logged in CRM; critical letters are saved to the SharePoint credit file. EDC provides curated wording guides – e.g. a “Underwriter Communication Email Templates” library – which UWs use to ensure accuracy and professionalism in messaging.

*   **Trip Reports and Visit Briefs:** When underwriters meet foreign buyers or conduct on-site due diligence, they create **Pre-Visit Briefs** and **Post-Visit Trip Reports**. A pre-visit brief outlines objectives and known issues about the buyer; the trip report documents findings from meetings and site inspections. These reports are typically co-authored if both an underwriter and a risk analyst attend the visit, and they summarize the buyer’s operations, management impressions, and any credit implications of the visit. *Audience:* Internal (shared with underwriters, RAs, and management to update the buyer’s file). *Format:* Structured Word document or PowerPoint. *Frequency:* Occasionally (whenever travel occurs for due diligence, e.g., major buyer reviews – perhaps a few times a year). *Source-of-truth:* Trip reports are stored in the buyer’s CIS file or a designated SharePoint folder; key insights are also transcribed into the CIS comments tab for permanent record.

*   **Internal Memos & Exception Requests:** Underwriters sometimes draft short internal memos for special situations. For example, an *exception request memo* might be written to document why a policy deviation is being recommended and to record a manager’s approval for it. Another example is a *Board referral memo* if a transaction needs Board of Directors approval – summarizing the request for the executive team. *Audience:* Internal executives or committees. *Format:* Typically a one- to two-page email or document citing the issue and recommendation. *Frequency:* Infrequent (only as needed for escalations). *Source-of-truth:* Attached to the credit file and emailed through proper channels (e.g., to the Secretary for Board packages). [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Murphy%2c+Andrew)

**B. Documents Underwriters RECEIVE/REVIEW:**

*   **Customer Financial Statements & Credit Information:** A fundamental input for underwriting. Underwriters regularly examine company financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements) of buyers or borrowers to assess creditworthiness. They often receive these as PDF or Excel documents provided by the customer or retrieved via EDC’s info sourcing process. They look for trends (revenue, profitability, leverage, liquidity) and often recalc key ratios for the credit analysis. *Actions/Decisions:* Determine the company’s financial health, calculate risk ratings, decide if additional information or clarifications are needed from the client.

*   **Credit Reports and Agency Ratings:** For many buyers, underwriters pull **credit agency reports** (e.g. Dun & Bradstreet reports, Equifax credit scores, S\&P/Moody’s ratings for larger firms). These reports are either automatically fetched by internal systems or obtained through the Info Sourcing team, and provide summary credit opinions, payment history, legal filings, etc. Underwriters review these to cross-verify financials and identify any red flags (e.g., past delinquencies, legal judgments). *Actions:* Integrate third-party risk signals into the credit decision (for instance, a low D\&B Paydex or a negative rating outlook may lead to a lower credit limit or request for collateral).

*   **Customer Applications and Deal Narratives:** Underwriters analyze the **application materials** submitted by customers. In credit insurance, this is the online application form detailing the buyer, requested credit limit, and any known issues – often supplemented by explanations from the exporter or broker (e.g., “Buyer requested extended terms due to market conditions”). In financing, they receive a **credit proposal pack** from BD including the company’s background, deal structure desired, and possibly a business plan or project info. They read these carefully to understand the request in context. *Actions:* Verify completeness (ensure all required info is provided), clarify any ambiguities with the account manager or client, and use the information as the basis for due diligence (e.g., verifying contract values, shipment timelines, etc.).

*   **Legal and Compliance Documents:** Underwriters often review or at least check the highlights of key legal documents tied to transactions. For loans: term sheets, loan agreements, guarantee wording – to ensure they match what was approved (e.g., confirming that financial covenant thresholds in the draft loan agreement align with the credit submission). In bonding/guarantees: bond forms or indemnity agreements to see that they are acceptable (with Legal’s guidance). They also receive **KYC/AML results** (e.g., a summary that the necessary screenings are clear or listing any concerns) which they must factor before final approval. *Actions:* Address any gaps (like instructing lawyers to add clauses for EDC’s requirements), or if a KYC report flags a sanctions issue, pause the transaction and escalate to compliance.

*   **Internal Policy & Risk Guidelines:** To make decisions, underwriters constantly reference internal policies and standards. They consult the **Delegation of Authority (DOA) matrices** to confirm whether they can sign off or need to obtain higher approval for a given exposure. They review product guidelines (for example, the *Credit Insurance Underwriting Guideline* or *Corporate Lending Underwriting Guideline*) to ensure their recommendation adheres to required credit criteria and procedures. *Actions:* If something in a file doesn’t comply, they adjust the structure or prepare an exception request. They also ensure all decisions are “within mandate” – if a transaction doesn’t fit EDC’s mandate or country limits, they must decline or get executive clearance, so they double-check these guidelines in the documentation they receive.

*   **Portfolio & Risk Monitoring Reports:** Underwriters occasionally review reports that provide a broader view of their portfolio performance. For example, a report might list all their pending credit reviews or upcoming renewals – e.g. an *Insurance Credit Review Tracking list* which flags which buyers need annual review and how many are overdue. In loans, they might receive a *Quarterly watchlist* or *Heightened Awareness List* report from Risk Management summarizing all obligors requiring special attention. *Actions:* Use these inputs to schedule work (e.g., prioritize a credit review that is overdue) and to focus on the riskiest accounts (e.g., intensifying monitoring on a borrower that shows up on the watchlist).

## 6. COMMUNICATION AND STAKEHOLDERS

*   **Key Internal Stakeholders:** Underwriters work closely with multiple internal roles. The primary relationship is with **Account Managers/Business Development (BD)** in the front line: BD “owns” the customer relationship and brings customer requests, while underwriters provide the credit decisions. They interact daily to clarify customer needs and discuss deal structuring (for instance, an account manager may ask why a certain term is required, and the underwriter will explain the risk rationale). **Risk Management (RMO/Risk Analysts):** for higher-risk or large exposures, underwriters coordinate with RMO’s Risk Analysts – e.g. a Risk Analyst might provide an independent opinion or additional analysis on a buyer, and both the UW and RA share responsibility for a sound decision. **Legal Services:** Underwriters consult EDC’s legal advisors on deal-specific issues (especially in structured financing or bonding cases) – ensuring documentation is enforceable and EDC’s rights are protected. **Advisory teams:** Underwriters collaborate with internal specialists such as the **Environmental and Social Risk team** and **Financial Crimes (AML/KYC) advisors** who review aspects of a deal. For example, an underwriter will incorporate the ESG advisor’s risk rating or requirements into the credit submission, and coordinate with them if any findings must be addressed. Additionally, underwriters of certain products work with **Insurance Operations** (for policy issuance) and **Finance** (for pricing or provisioning questions) as needed.

*   **Important External Stakeholders:** Underwriters are often the behind-the-scenes voice to customers. However, they do engage externally in specific scenarios: **Policyholders and Brokers** (for credit insurance) to explain credit decisions or gather more info on buyers; **Commercial Banks** (in guarantee programs or co-lending) to negotiate risk-sharing or get input on a buyer – e.g., in a foreign buyer credit limit > $10M, an underwriter may liaise with the buyer’s primary bank abroad via email to gather insight on that buyer’s conduct. Underwriters in bonding (Contract Insurance & Bonding) frequently talk to **surety partners** and Canadian clients’ bonding agents to align on terms. In some cases (usually larger or problematic deals), underwriters join **customer calls or meetings** along with account managers to present or clarify EDC’s credit requirements. For instance, they may join a meeting with a customer’s CFO to walk through covenants in a term sheet or to discuss why certain collateral is required. Underwriters also occasionally meet foreign **buyers** directly: e.g., during overseas credit evaluation trips or when buyers visit EDC – in such cases the underwriter may lead discussions to probe the buyer’s financial situation (with the Canadian exporter present or aware).

*   **Common Communications:** Internally, underwriters’ communications are often about clarifying risk and aligning on customer strategy. They frequently write to **Account Managers** providing the reasoning behind a credit decision (so the AM can convey it to the customer), or to seek additional info (“Please get the latest financials for buyer X”). Externally, the most frequent communications are **decision notices** via email: *approvals* (including any conditions the customer must meet), *declines* (with a polite explanation and often encouragement to provide new info for reconsideration), or *requests for information* (asking an exporter to submit updated financials or trade experience on a buyer). Underwriters strive to keep communications clear and customer-friendly, even when conveying tough news – EDC provides standard phrasing such as emphasizing that a decision “is based on full review of available information” and outlining next steps like the right to appeal. Underwriters also produce correspondence for special cases: e.g., **offer letters** for certain products, or **amendment agreements** when changing loan terms (often working from templates and having Legal vet changes).

*   **Meetings Led vs Attended:** Underwriters typically **attend** more meetings than they lead. In many meetings with customers or partners, the account manager leads and the underwriter supports by answering credit-related questions. Underwriters might **lead** an internal meeting when it’s specifically about credit risk – for example, an underwriter might convene a quick meeting with an account manager and a risk analyst to resolve a complex buyer issue. Underwriters also co-lead some recurring sessions: in small business insurance, a **weekly credit committee call** may have underwriters rotating as chair to go through borderline applications as a group for consistency. Senior Underwriters or Team Leads sometimes host **knowledge-sharing sessions** (e.g., a monthly “case study review” meeting to discuss a past deal and lessons learned). Underwriters **attend** all formal credit approval meetings for their deals (credit committee, DDF, or Board discussions) as subject matter experts, though a more senior person may chair those. They also attend **portfolio reviews** and **product improvement meetings**, providing frontline perspective (e.g., feedback on underwriting process pain points to a project team).

*   **Presentations/Briefings:** While not a routine part of every week, underwriters do prepare and deliver presentations in certain contexts. For high-value financing deals that require Board approval, underwriters may brief the **Senior Management or the Board Credit Committee**, walking them through the credit submission and answering questions on the borrower. Underwriters also present occasionally in internal training forums (sharing insights on a sector or a unique structuring of a deal). Frequency is occasional – perhaps a few times a year for most UWs, though senior staff may present more often.

*   **Time-Heavy Communication Tasks:** Underwriters devote considerable effort to ensuring **clear, thorough correspondence**. Drafting a detailed decline explanation or a complicated conditional approval can take significant time, as they must be careful with wording (to be transparent but diplomatic). Coordinating multi-party calls (finding time for a busy client, their bank, and EDC teams) is another time-consuming aspect. Rewriting technical credit rationale into **plain language for customers** is an important but non-trivial task – e.g., explaining a complex financial concept like debt-to-equity requirements in an accessible way. Underwriters may also spend time coaching account managers on how to deliver certain messages to clients.

## 7. DATA AND INFORMATION HANDLING

*   **Customer and Counterparty Data:** Underwriters regularly handle *non-public financial information* of companies – including audited financial statements, interim results, revenue figures, accounts receivable aging, and banking information of Canadian exporters and their foreign buyers. They also review corporate organizational details, ownership information (sometimes including **personal data of principals or guarantors**), and details of contracts (e.g., copy of a purchase order or commercial contract to verify a transaction). All such data provided by customers is considered **Protected (confidential) information** under EDC’s Info Security Classification, and underwriters must ensure it is stored and shared only through secure internal systems. For example, a buyer’s financial statements must be kept in the restricted-access CIS file or secure SharePoint folder – not emailed externally other than to the Canadian policyholder or an approved partner on a need-to-know basis.

*   **Sensitive Risk Data:** Underwriters routinely work with sensitive risk assessments. They use EDC’s internal credit ratings (which are confidential) and may see *Material Non-Public Information (MNPI)* about companies (e.g., proposed M\&A transactions or expansion plans that customers share in confidence). They treat such information with strict caution. Underwriters are trained on **information firewalls**: e.g., if they learn MNPI about a publicly traded company during due diligence, they must refrain from sharing it improperly or trading on it, as per EDC’s Code of Conduct. They also receive sensitive reports like country risk ratings and Economic reports that are not public.

*   **Compliance and Regulatory Constraints:** Underwriters must adhere to internal and external regulations in their use of data. They are mindful of privacy laws (e.g., protecting any personal identifiers of company owners or beneficial owners obtained during KYC checks). They also follow data retention rules – credit files must contain all key information and be retained per EDC’s record management schedule. Regulations such as the **Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA)** and sanctions laws affect underwriting: underwriters ensure no prohibited parties or countries are involved in a transaction (via KYC/AML screening results). EDC’s *Responsible AI/GenAI Policy* specifically impacts underwriters’ data handling: they are **forbidden from inputting any Non-Public EDC information (like client financials or contracts) into external generative AI tools**, as it could lead to unintended disclosure. They must use only approved, secure tools when working with customer data.

*   **Financial Data and PII Exposure:** Most data underwriters see is corporate financial information rather than personal data, but there are instances of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** – e.g., personal guarantees by business owners (revealing personal net worth, home addresses, etc.), or credit bureau scores of small business owners. This data is classified as *Protected B* at EDC, meaning unauthorized disclosure could cause serious harm. Underwriters uphold strict confidentiality: they only share such details internally with those who need to know (e.g., discussing an owner’s credit score with a risk colleague evaluating the same case).

*   **Data-Related Risks:** The biggest risks include **inaccurate or incomplete information** (which could lead to a wrong credit decision) and **data leakage** (which could breach customer trust and legal requirements). Underwriters mitigate the first by seeking validation – e.g., cross-checking financial figures with multiple sources, requesting bank references to verify buyer payment history, and using their experience to detect anomalies (like a sudden jump in sales that needs explanation). They mitigate data leaks by strictly following EDC’s security protocols: using encryption for sending sensitive info, not discussing client specifics over unsecured channels, and not uploading documents to any unauthorized platforms.

*   **Safe AI Use Boundaries:** According to EDC’s GenAI policy, underwriters (like all employees) must **never input confidential customer or deal data into public AI chatbots or unapproved analytics tools**. If they use internal AI (like M365 Copilot) on a document, they must ensure no disallowed data is being sent outside EDC’s tenant. They are required to **carefully review any AI-generated content** for accuracy and appropriateness before using it, especially in external communications. They must also clearly disclose AI-generated content if it’s used (e.g., if an underwriting assistant used an AI to draft part of a document, the material needs review and likely a note in the working papers, per policy). These boundaries ensure that while underwriters may leverage productivity gains from AI, they do so without compromising data security or professional judgment.

## 8. DECISIONS AND JUDGMENT

*   **Critical Decisions:** Underwriters make decisions that directly affect EDC’s risk and customers’ ability to obtain support. The most important is the **credit decision** itself – approving or declining a request for credit support (insurance or financing) and on what terms. These decisions have financial stakes: an approval exposes EDC to potential loss (e.g., paying an insurance claim or a loan default), while a decline means a Canadian exporter might lose a sale. Underwriters must balance being **prudent** (protecting EDC from unacceptable risk) with being **facilitative** (enabling business within risk appetite). They also decide on risk mitigants: e.g., approving a limit but only against a letter of credit, or requiring a guarantee, or setting a smaller amount than requested. Another key decision area is **portfolio actions**: whether to continue coverage/support on a deteriorating account or to cancel/reduce exposure. For instance, if a buyer becomes past due or its financials weaken, the underwriter decides if the policy limit should be revoked or kept with tighter terms. These judgments can significantly impact claim payouts and customer relationships.

*   **Consequences of Mistakes:** Errors in judgment can have **high consequences**. Overly generous decisions (approving too much risk) can lead to **financial losses** – e.g., paying a multi-million dollar insurance claim because a buyer defaulted on a limit that, in hindsight, was set too high or extended despite warning signs. Conversely, an overly conservative decision (unnecessarily declining or under-supporting a customer) can result in **lost Canadian business opportunities** and reputational damage if clients feel EDC was not fair. Underwriters also face the risk of **policy non-compliance**: approving something outside of policy or their authority can expose EDC to policy breaches or require after-the-fact remediation. For example, mis-applying the Delegation of Authority (signing off beyond their approval limit) is a serious lapse. Therefore, underwriters double-check authority tables for every approval. Mistakes in fulfilling legal requirements (like neglecting a necessary KYC check or missing a sanction issue) can result in regulatory breaches. In short, the biggest areas of consequence are **credit losses, compliance/regulatory breaches, and damage to EDC’s credibility** with customers or partners.

*   **Verification Before Action:** Underwriters have a strong verification mindset. They rarely act on one source of information alone. Before finalizing a credit decision, they **verify key facts**: cross-referencing financials with bank references or credit reports, ensuring that calculations (like debt ratios or risk rating outputs) match source data, confirming that proposed terms meet all policy requirements. If an exporter provides sales projections that seem optimistic, the underwriter will check them against historical trends and may ask the customer or BD for more context. For compliance, underwriters verify that **all required screenings** (sanctions, anti-corruption, ESG) have been completed and any issues resolved before signing off. A standard step is confirming that transactions align with EDC’s mandate (the exporter and buyer are eligible, Canadian benefit is met, etc.) – anything uncertain here is escalated or declined, not assumed. Essentially, underwriters develop a habit of *healthy skepticism* and double-checking: for every credit recommendation, they ask “What needs to be true for this to make sense?” and verify those elements.

*   **Escalation Triggers:** Underwriters know clearly when to **escalate decisions** to higher authorities or specialist teams. Triggers include: **Credit beyond authority** – if a requested exposure exceeds their personal DOA limit (e.g., a large loan or an insurance limit above a certain USD threshold), they must forward it to a higher-level approver (Manager/Director, VPs, or Board). **Heightened risk** – if at any point they identify risks outside normal bounds (e.g., potential fraud signs, significant legal concerns), they engage second-line Risk Management and possibly EDC’s Risk Committee. **Policy exceptions** – anything that conflicts with established policy requires managerial approval or committee sign-off; for example, supporting a buyer in a sanctioned country would require senior executive clearance. **Ethical or reputational issues** – e.g., if an application raises concerns about environmental harms or bribery, underwriters escalate to the appropriate internal committees regardless of the size of the deal. **Customer complaints or political sensitivity** – e.g., if a declined credit could have serious fallout (maybe a prominent exporter is upset), an underwriter flags this to management and potentially the Customer Experience team. By design, EDC’s processes encourage proactive escalation: underwriters are told that **deviating from standard responsibilities requires Manager/Director approval, which fosters a culture of “when in doubt, raise it.”**

*   **Exercising Good Judgment:** *“Good judgment”* for an underwriter means making decisions that are well-supported, unbiased, and mindful of both risk and client needs. Observable behaviors include: **Thorough Analysis** – e.g., an underwriter who clearly documents all relevant financial details and rationale in a buyer’s file, showing they didn’t rely on assumptions. **Asking for second opinions** – e.g., seeking input from a colleague or risk partner on an unusual scenario, reflecting self-awareness of one’s limits. **Consistency and fairness** – top underwriters apply standards evenly: they don’t play favorites or cut corners under pressure. **Knowing when to say no (and yes)** – a strong underwriter can decline a deal that doesn’t meet criteria, but also identify mitigants that could turn a *“no”* into a *“yes”* when appropriate (for instance, suggesting the customer provide a standby letter of credit so a marginal deal can be approved). **Transparency** – clearly communicating the reasons behind decisions internally and in the credit file, even if it means delivering tough messages, is a mark of good judgment. Underwriters are expected to back their decisions with evidence and sound reasoning, and the best performers do so consistently, earning trust from both colleagues and customers.

## 9. PAIN POINTS AND TIME SINKS

*   **Common Frustrations:** Underwriters face **process and system frustrations** that can slow their work. A major complaint is the **lack of integration between systems**, leading to duplicate data entry and potential errors – e.g., having to update a buyer’s financial info in one system and again in a separate spreadsheet or database. They also report frustration with receiving **incomplete applications or information** from customers, which triggers back-and-forth communications and delays decisions. Another pain point is the sometimes **inconsistent process across products**: EDC has different workflows for different solutions (insurance vs. guarantees vs. financing), meaning underwriters must navigate varying rules and interfaces for similar credit tasks. This can be confusing to customers and to staff, especially when clients transition between products. For example, an underwriter in Small Business may handle a Credit Insurance request in one system and a Guarantee request in another, even if the credit fundamentals are alike. Also, underwriters often feel the pressure of **tight turnaround times** – service level targets are high, and any bottleneck (like waiting for a risk analyst’s review or a system slowdown) becomes a frustration when they know clients are waiting. Lastly, high workload in peak periods is a chronic issue – one analysis in the Mid-Market Lending team identified *11 pain points* affecting capacity, such as redundant templates and siloed tools, which if resolved could free up significant time per transaction.

*   **Manual Work vs. Automation Opportunities:** Underwriters perform many manual tasks ripe for automation. For instance, prior to the introduction of the Unified Credit Model (UCM), they spent time copying the same data from one form to another to compile credit documents. In insurance, they manually clicked through multiple screens to update each buyer review; in lending, they manually generated Word documents for each new credit. Recognizing this, EDC has been investing in automation – UCM now automates a portion of credit memo drafting for low-risk cases, and robotic process automations (RPAs) are being explored to update systems or pull financial statement data. Underwriters still see more opportunities: for example, automating the retrieval of routine documents (like pulling a fresh credit report or financial spread from a database) or auto-generating standard correspondence. These would reduce the time spent on low-value tasks and allow focusing on analysis. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

*   **Bottlenecks and Handoffs:** Parts of the underwriting process can become **bottlenecks**, especially when multiple handoffs are involved. A common choke point is the **Risk Analyst/Manager queue** – when many credit limit requests require secondary review by RAs or RMO, underwriters must wait for those inputs, delaying customer responses. Similarly, transactions that need legal document drafting can stall if Legal has a heavy volume (e.g., year-end rush causing a wait for loan document review). Underwriters often plan around these bottlenecks by engaging support early (for instance, flagging a coming deal to Legal in advance). The lack of an integrated end-to-end system also creates mini-bottlenecks – underwriters might finish their analysis, but then need to email another team or re-enter data to trigger the next step, waiting for someone else to pick it up. **Approvals at higher levels** can be another delay: an underwriting decision may sit pending for days if a senior approver is traveling, while the underwriter and client wait. Underwriters manage this by proactive escalation (e.g., alerting their manager early about an incoming large deal) and by ensuring the approval package is complete and clear (reducing back-and-forth questions).

*   **Potential Gains from 2 Extra Hours/Week (Hypotheses):** *If underwriters had a bit more free time, they could reinvest it in value-added activities.* **(Hypothesis 1)**: *Deepening portfolio risk insight* – They might perform more comprehensive monitoring of their portfolio, such as trending analysis on buyer groups or industries, which is often squeezed out by daily tasks. This could pre-empt problems and improve credit quality management. **(Hypothesis 2)**: *Client outreach and education* – Underwriters could join more customer calls (with account managers) to explain EDC’s credit requirements or discuss how to strengthen a client’s credit profile. This would build trust and potentially lead to better applications (reducing rework). **(Hypothesis 3)**: *Process improvement projects* – Many underwriters have ideas to improve tools and policies. With extra time, they could collaborate with IT or product teams to refine underwriting models, test new systems (like an enhanced workflow in ServiceNow), or update outdated job aids. Such involvement could ultimately save time for the whole team and improve risk controls. (These are forward-looking estimates; EDC’s ongoing **Process Improvement** initiatives often rely on underwriter input and have shown that even small time savings per transaction multiply significantly at scale.)

## 10. PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS METRICS

*   **Performance Measurement:** Underwriters’ performance is measured on both **productivity** and **portfolio quality**. Key metrics include: **Throughput & Timeliness** – e.g., number of credit decisions per month and % completed within SLA (service level agreement). For instance, Small Business underwriters may have a target like “95% of new credit limit requests decided within 5 days”. In Mid-Market and larger deals, metrics like average underwriting turnaround (cycle time) are tracked and compared to targets. **Risk outcomes** – such as portfolio *loss ratio* or *delinquency rate* for the credits underwritten. While losses are a multi-year outcome and not solely attributable to one underwriter, high-level portfolio KPIs (claims paid, impairments) are monitored by segment. At the individual level, managers qualitatively assess whether an underwriter’s decisions are **sound** (e.g., via annual file audits and reviewing any credit surprises like unexpected claims or downgrades). **Client impact** – Underwriters contribute indirectly to customer satisfaction. EDC monitors **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** for solutions like credit insurance and guarantees; underwriters aim to maintain service quality that supports high NPS (e.g., meeting response time commitments and providing clear reasons for decisions). They also have goals around **customer retention** (e.g., working with account managers to renew expiring policies) and **“multi-solution usage”** (helping customers find alternative solutions if one product isn’t a fit).

*   **Top Performer vs Average:** *Observable differences (based on management feedback and peer input):* Top-performing underwriters tend to be **organized and proactive**, maintaining low backlog and anticipating issues before they escalate – for example, a high performer will notice a policy is coming up for renewal and start the review early, whereas an average performer might react last-minute. Top UWs are also known for **sound judgment and consistency**, meaning their decisions rarely require revision by managers. They document their files thoroughly and align with guidelines, making audits uneventful (managers find all required info easily, indicating the underwriter is methodical). High performers often take on more complex files and still turn them around within deadlines, whereas less experienced peers might struggle with similar volume. In peer discussions, certain underwriters stand out for being the “go-to” for tough calls or mentoring – a sign of mastery is when others routinely seek your advice on structuring and risk interpretation. *(These observations are drawn from role expectation documents and leadership criteria, but exact comparative performance data was not found. The statements combining evidence and plausible interpretation are labeled as hypotheses.)*

*   **Valued Skills and Capabilities:** The skillset of a successful underwriter blends financial acumen, risk intuition, and communication. **Credit analysis skills** (ability to dissect financial statements and identify key risk drivers) are fundamental. **Attention to detail** is heavily emphasized – small errors can have big consequences, so being detail-oriented in reviewing documents and inputting data is a must. **Time management** is crucial given the volume of work and tight SLAs; top underwriters excel at prioritization and efficiency. **Collaboration and communication** skills differentiate those who are merely technically good from those who are truly effective – an underwriter who can clearly explain decisions and work smoothly with others (BD, risk, clients) creates better outcomes and is highly valued. In recent years, **adaptability** has also become important: underwriters face changing tools (new systems, AI assistance) and evolving policies, so the ability to quickly learn and adjust (e.g., learn a new system interface like the switch from CIS to the new platform) is noted by management.

*   **Common Development Areas:** *Areas where underwriters often seek to improve:* **Industry knowledge** – understanding specialized industries (e.g., complex project finance, or niche sectors for insurance) to better assess risks; EDC provides sector-specific job aids and encourages rotations for learning. **Soft skills** – new underwriters often work on improving their writing and client communication tone, transforming “credit-speak” into plain language. **Delegation comfort** – less experienced UWs may initially escalate too much or too little; coaching focuses on knowing when to decide independently versus when to seek guidance. **Digital proficiency** – as underwriting becomes more digital, skill gaps in using data tools or AI may need addressing (for example, learning to effectively use a new dashboard or to critically evaluate AI outputs). *(Specific statistics on skill gaps were not found; these points are inferred from typical training focus and are provided as context.)*

## 11. CURRENT AI TOOL USAGE (IF EVIDENCED)

*   **AI Tools in Use:** EDC’s underwriting teams are in early stages of adopting AI. As of 2025, the primary exposure is via **Microsoft 365 Copilot** (in a pilot phase) and the internal **Unified Credit Model (UCM)** for credit automation. The **UCM** is a behind-the-scenes AI that auto-generates draft credit analysis text for low-risk, straightforward insurance applications. It pulls data from internal systems (buyer & policy info) and produces a preliminary credit write-up for the underwriter to refine. Some underwriters also use **Copilot in Word** to outline credit memos or simplify language in emails, and **Copilot in Outlook** to summarize long email threads. A few tech-savvy underwriters have tried using **ChatGPT or Bing Chat** (with fictional or sanitized data) at home to experiment with credit analysis phrasing or to practice scenarios, but this is unofficial and done cautiously due to data restrictions. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

*   **Use Cases and Benefits:** Initial use cases include **drafting communications** (especially crafting clear, concise explanations of credit decisions) and accelerating **document preparation**. Underwriters report that UCM’s automated credit documentation has reduced the time spent on writing the most routine buyer reviews – it populates standard text and tables, allowing the UW to focus on the judgmental parts. Copilot has been handy for creating first drafts of customer emails (“It helps when I’m stuck on how to phrase a delicate decline” – as one underwriter put it). Another use case is **information retrieval**: using AI search capabilities to quickly find relevant guidance in the trove of policy documents (for example, querying a knowledge base for the exact phrasing of a policy rule rather than reading a 50-page PDF). [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah), [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

*   **What Works Well:** AI tools have shown promise in handling *structured, repetitive tasks*. UCM’s credit report assembly frees up time that was spent collating data into the Credit Shell. Copilot’s ability to summarize or rephrase text helps underwriters produce clearer explanations, which is improving consistency in customer communications. Also, the AI-driven search pilot has made it faster to find historical precedents (“I can ask the bot if we’ve ever approved a buyer in country X with this issue, and it points me to a 2019 file,” noted as an experiment in knowledge management). These successes are still being evaluated, but early feedback is positive on efficiency gains. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)

*   **Concerns and Cautions:** Despite these benefits, underwriters have expressed **concerns** about AI’s accuracy and data security. They are acutely aware that an AI’s *“hallucination”* (confident but incorrect output) could lead to a bad decision or a misleading statement to a client. Therefore, they double-check any AI-generated content. There is also a cultural caution: underwriters feel responsible for their credit decisions and are wary of over-relying on an AI – they use it as a tool, not an oracle. Privacy and compliance are another worry: underwriters handle sensitive data, which **EDC policy forbids uploading to external AI services**. They stick to approved tools and often prefer to do certain analyses manually to avoid inadvertent data exposure. Finally, some underwriters have noted that AI sometimes can’t capture the nuance of a credit story – for instance, a borrower’s qualitative issues – so they are careful to not let AI oversimplify the assessment. Management is actively addressing these concerns through training on EDC’s *Responsible AI Use Policy* to ensure underwriters know how to use AI safely and effectively.

*   **Known Misuse/Risks:** No incidents of misuse have been reported publicly, as the GenAI tools are still new and access is controlled. There is, however, a perceived risk that a well-meaning underwriter might, for example, paste a buyer’s financials into an AI chatbot to get a quick spread or translation – which would violate policy. To preempt this, EDC’s GenAI training uses underwriting scenarios to reinforce rules (e.g., do **not** share customer names or financial figures with ChatGPT; use internal tools instead). So far, underwriters have been cautious, and any use of AI is typically pre-approved and monitored.

## 12. REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE CONTEXT

*   **Regulatory Environment:** Underwriters must adhere to both EDC’s internal credit policies and external legal regulations. As a Crown corporation focused on trade, EDC is governed by the **Export Development Act** and must operate within its mandate (supporting Canadian export trade). Underwriters ensure each transaction satisfies the mandate and any relevant Government directives. For example, since 2014 EDC has had a directive to abstain from new business involving Russia and (since 2022) Belarus; underwriters strictly follow these country exclusions and will automatically decline or refer any such applications (EDC’s systems flag prohibited country names for them). They also incorporate compliance with global regulations like sanctions laws (e.g. not supporting designated persons or sanctioned countries), anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements, and anti-bribery/corruption laws (e.g. ensuring clients sign anti-corruption declarations and are screened). For certain regulated industries or high-risk exports, underwriters must verify additional approvals: e.g., defense-related deals must comply with Canadian government policies and may require political sign-off. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=Lam%2c+Harold)

*   **Client Communication and Record-Keeping:** EDC underwriters operate under obligations to maintain transparency and proper records. All credit decisions and their rationale need to be documented (for internal audit and potentially for the Office of the Auditor General oversight). They are cautious in **client communications** to avoid misrepresentation. EDC has guidelines to ensure communications are factual and not misleading. For instance, if a limit is declined, underwriters should state the decision is based on information available and not make speculative comments about the buyer. In terms of record-keeping, underwriting decisions and supporting analysis are retained in the official digital file. This is crucial for compliance – if a client appeals a decision or if a decision is reviewed (internally or by the Office of the Chief Risk Officer), the underwriter’s documented rationale and data must justify the outcome.

*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** Failure to adhere to regulations and policies can have serious consequences. If an underwriter inadvertently supports a deal that violates sanctions or export controls, EDC could face legal penalties or reputational damage. Similarly, neglecting to apply environment or social due diligence (e.g., not identifying that a customer deal triggers an excluded sector like coal projects) could result in EDC breaching its own policies or Canada’s international commitments. Underwriters manage these risks by using checklists and relying on expert teams – for example, always checking the **Financial Crimes (FC) KYC and sanctions results** and not proceeding if any red flags appear. They also know that any significant exception (like a policy breach) must go to senior management or the Board for approval by formal process,, and skipping that process is a serious offense. Practically, EDC’s system controls and culture make such lapses rare (e.g., systems will prevent issuing a policy for a banned country).

*   **Restrictions on AI Use:** As noted, underwriters are bound by EDC’s *Responsible Use of GenAI Policy* which is framed by broader public sector guidelines (e.g., the Government of Canada’s FASTER principles for AI). The policy emphasizes not inputting confidential business information into AI and ensuring human oversight. Underwriters treat AI outputs as *informational support*, not official credit analysis, to align with the requirement that human expertise and approval remain central in credit decisions. They also maintain transparency by disclosing use of AI in any materials (though as a rule they avoid using AI to generate final client-facing documents).

## 13. AI TRAINING DESIGN SEEDS

**A) Operational Anchors for AI-Skills Training:**

*   **Analyzing a New Buyer Application:** *Task:* Use an AI assistant to quickly summarize a foreign buyer’s financial statements and payment history from various sources, then draft a risk assessment. *Skill domain:* **Verification and Judgment** – The learner must prompt the AI for key risk factors and then critically verify the AI’s summary against source documents, identifying any discrepancies or missing context before using it in a credit decision.
*   **Drafting a Decline Email:** *Task:* Have the learner use an AI tool to compose a customer email explaining a credit limit decline. *Skill domain:* **Prompting for Outcomes** – The focus is on crafting a prompt that yields a clear, polite explanation including reasons for the decision and next steps (appeal or new info), and then refining the AI’s output to align with EDC’s communication standards.
*   **Policy Check with AI:** *Task:* Present the learner with a complex deal scenario and an AI search tool configured with EDC policies. The learner uses the AI to find relevant policy sections (e.g., on allowable tenors or country limits) and determine if the deal fits. *Skill domain:* **Tool Fluency (M365 + Copilot)** – Tests ability to leverage AI search (like Bing Chat Enterprise or Copilot) to quickly retrieve policy rules, while ensuring the information is up-to-date and correctly interpreted. [\[office.com\]](https://www.office.com/search?q=van+Wolde%2c+Sarah)
*   **Data Integrity Audit:** *Task:* Simulate a situation where an underwriter must review an AI-generated credit analysis for a buyer. The learner identifies factual errors or unsupported statements in the AI’s analysis by cross-checking with original financial data provided. *Skill domain:* **Verification and Judgment** – Emphasizes not accepting AI outputs at face value and reinforces cross-verification of data before relying on it.
*   **Managing Sensitive Information:** *Task:* The learner is asked to use an AI assistant to help prepare an internal credit memo that includes sensitive figures (e.g., proprietary financials). They must determine which information can be shared with the AI and use features like redaction or synthetic data for sensitive parts. *Skill domain:* **Data Safety and Compliance** – Tests understanding of EDC’s GenAI usage rules (no non-public data in external AI; using only approved tools) and ability to sanitize inputs while still getting value from AI.
*   **AI Support in Portfolio Monitoring:** *Task:* Provide the learner with a large dataset of a portfolio (numerous buyers with financial metrics). Have them use an AI/ML tool to identify which accounts might be trending towards trouble (clustering or trend analysis), then interpret the results. *Skill domain:* **Tool Fluency (M365 + Copilot)** – The learner practices feeding data to an AI (in a secure environment) and interpreting visualizations or patterns (like an AI-generated chart highlighting buyers with declining sales and increasing overdue percentages). They then decide which accounts indeed require action, reinforcing human oversight.
*   **Improving a Draft Credit Submission:** *Task:* The learner is given a rough draft of a credit memo (some sections deliberately sub-par). They must use an AI writing assistant to polish the language and structure *without altering the risk content*. *Skill domain:* **Prompting for Outcomes** – They practice instructing the AI to improve clarity and organization, but also practice constraints (e.g., “Do not change any financial figures or credit recommendations”) to preserve accuracy, showing mastery of controlling AI outputs.
*   **Simulated Decision Forum with AI Feedback:** *Task:* In a role-play of a Daily Deal Forum, the learner presents a case and then must respond to an “AI risk advisor” (simulated by the facilitator or an AI) that challenges their decision with alternate viewpoints or stress-test questions. *Skill domain:* **Verification and Judgment** – The learner experiences an AI probing their logic (e.g., “What if the buyer’s sales drop 20%? How would you mitigate?”) and must use critical thinking to either justify their position or adjust the decision. This develops judgment under pressure and the ability to use AI as a sparring partner.

**B) Scenario Seeds:** *(Each scenario is a potential real-world situation where an underwriter’s use of AI could go wrong if not careful, to be used for training.)*

1.  **Company:** *Maple Machinery Corp.*  
    **Trigger:** A mid-sized Canadian exporter asks for a $5M loan guarantee for a rush sale; their email includes last-minute financial forecasts in an attached Excel. The underwriter has one day to assess credit and respond.  
    **AI\_temptation:** Use *Microsoft 365 Copilot* to feed the entire financial forecast workbook (with non-public revenue figures) into a ChatGPT prompt for analysis and credit memo drafting – thereby violating policy on sharing confidential data with an AI.  
    **Skill\_test:** Recognizing that customer financials are highly sensitive, the underwriter must find ways to leverage AI without exposing confidential data (e.g., using internal tools or abstracting the data first) – demonstrating **Data Safety and Compliance** awareness.  
    **Domain:** **data\_safety**

2.  **Company:** *Prairie Export Insurance Ltd.*  
    **Trigger:** An underwriter is swamped with 20 new buyer limit applications. One is from a loyal client pressing for rapid approval. The underwriter considers using an AI tool to auto-generate decisions.  
    **AI\_temptation:** Rely on an *internal credit automation AI* to fully decide a $500k credit limit and copy its recommended decision and reasoning into the file without manual validation or analysis – risking an unvetted decision with potential errors.  
    **Skill\_test:** The underwriter must apply **Verification and Judgment** by reviewing and confirming any AI-generated credit recommendation, correcting any faulty assumptions before making the final decision.

3.  **Company:** *Northern Equipment Finance*  
    **Trigger:** A banker from a partner financial institution calls about a complex loan restructure. The underwriter doesn’t fully understand part of the banker’s proposal involving a “semi-subordinated intercreditor arrangement.”  
    **AI\_temptation:** Secretly paste the banker’s detailed term sheet into *Bing Chat* to have it explained, ignoring that it contains client identifiers and deal specifics – exposing confidential deal terms to an external service.  
    **Skill\_test:** The underwriter should demonstrate **Data Safety and Compliance** by refraining from divulging deal details. Instead, they might use approved internal AI or rephrase questions generically (e.g., asking about intercreditor concepts without sharing names or amounts).  
    **Domain:** **data\_safety**

4.  **Company:** *Westport Furniture Ltd.*  
    **Trigger:** The exporter’s buyer was declined due to weak financials. The exporter, upset, asks for a detailed explanation.  
    **AI\_temptation:** Let *Copilot* draft the entire explanation email and send it off without a thorough review, trusting it to cover the reasons – risking a message that may contain errors or an inappropriate tone.  
    **Skill\_test:** The learner must use **Prompting for Outcomes** to guide AI in drafting a clear and courteous explanation, then exercise **Verification and Judgment** to edit the draft, ensure accuracy (e.g., no reference to any competitor’s data or internal risk models), and include proper guidance on next steps (like how to appeal).  
    **Domain:** **prompting**

5.  **Company:** *GreenTech Solutions Inc.*  
    **Trigger:** A senior underwriter is preparing a credit submission for Board approval on a major loan. Time is short.  
    **AI\_temptation:** Use *ChatGPT* to quickly summarize the borrower’s ESG risks and copy the AI’s summary into the Board memo verbatim – instead of using the official ESG advisor’s report – because it’s faster.  
    **Skill\_test:** Emphasize **Verification and Judgment** and **Tool Fluency**: the underwriter should validate facts with the actual ESG report and use AI only to supplement writing style. They must recognize that replacing expert analysis with unverified AI content could lead to misinformation.  
    **Domain:** **verification**

**C) Domain-to-Workflow Map:** How key parts of the Underwriter’s job engage each AI skill domain:

| **Domain**                        | **Highest-Risk / Highest-Value Moments for Underwriters**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Prompting for Outcomes**        | Crafting clear **customer communications** and internal recommendations. Underwriters often need to translate complex credit decisions into plain language emails or briefing notes. Using AI to assist in writing these, they must prompt effectively (e.g., provide context about the decision and desired tone) and then refine the output. Training focuses on scenarios like writing declination explanations or covenant summaries where good prompts produce helpful drafts, but poor prompts could lead to confusing or non-compliant messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Verification and Judgment**     | **Credit analysis validation and AI-generated content review.** Underwriters must double-check all data-driven outputs. For example, when using the UCM tool to draft a credit summary, they verify every financial ratio and risk rating it produces against source documents. Similarly, if AI highlights a trend in a buyer’s payments, the underwriter uses judgment to confirm the trend is real and relevant. This domain is tested whenever an AI suggests a decision or analysis – the underwriter’s role is to critically assess and never approve/support purely because “the AI said so.”                                                                                                             |
| **Data Safety and Compliance**    | **Handling confidential credit data with AI tools.** Underwriters deal with sensitive financial and personal data daily, so they must know how to keep it secure. High-risk moments include: using any AI tool that could expose non-public information (e.g., pasting client data into an unauthorized app). Training scenarios emphasize that customer financials, contracts, and PII must not be shared with external AI, and internal Copilot use should conform to EDC’s GenAI policy. The value is in learning to utilize AI smartly (like summarizing generic text or using anonymized inputs) without leaking sensitive details.  |
| **Tool Fluency (M365 + Copilot)** | **Streamlining credit processes with new tools.** As EDC integrates Copilot and other AI into credit workflows, underwriters will be tested on knowing which tool to use and how. Examples: using Copilot in Excel to quickly analyze trends in a financial dataset, or using Copilot’s integration with Teams to get a quick answer from a policy manual during a meeting. The highest value (and risk) is when speed is needed – e.g., using Copilot under tight time pressure to outline a credit memo. Underwriters must be fluent enough with the AI to do this quickly, but also know the tool’s limits (for instance, recognizing when Copilot’s summary of policy might be outdated or missing context). |

**Evidence Coverage:** Development of this profile drew on internal EDC documents and tools: *Role Clarity guidelines for Underwriters (credit insurance and bonding)*, the *Corporate Lending Underwriting & Asset Management Guideline*, *Underwriter communication templates*, and EDC’s *Responsible Use of GenAI Policy*. Meeting transcripts and project documents on workflow improvement and AI adoption (e.g., UCM implementation) were also referenced. These sources provide a data-grounded view of underwriters’ responsibilities, tools, pain points, and the evolving integration of AI in their work.
