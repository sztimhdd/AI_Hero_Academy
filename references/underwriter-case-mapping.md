**TASK 1 & 2 – Relevance Filtering and Domain Mapping**  
After reviewing all 110 use cases, I identified the following use cases as **most relevant (HIGH)** or **somewhat relevant (MEDIUM)** to an Underwriter’s work at EDC. The table below lists the shortlisted use cases, explains their relevance to the Underwriter role, and indicates the primary AI **Skill Domain** each use case best exemplifies. I’ve also flagged which use cases naturally span **multiple domains** (Capstone candidates).

This use case involves using AI to **summarize internal policies for easier understanding** [\[Complete-L...orized-110 \| Excel\]](https://edcanada-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hhu_edc_ca/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B20AF7CD2-8D31-4881-BC1B-EF8D6683DE6C%7D&file=Complete-List-Categorized-110.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true). That directly supports underwriters, who frequently reference policy manuals and could benefit from quick summaries (instead of reading entire policy documents for each deal). They would still need to confirm the summary’s accuracy (due to high stakes – Role Profile Section 8: “mistakes have high consequences”), but this could save time in identifying relevant rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | MEDIUM    | **Prompting for Outcomes** – asking Copilot to summarize policy documents into usable guidance, then using the output in decision-making.                        | N                                                                       |

Underwriters could employ Copilot to aggregate data and draft their credit memo or executive summary more efficiently, then carefully review it for completeness and accuracy (Role Profile Section 8: ensuring all key points are covered and correct).                                                                                                                                                                                                            | MEDIUM    | **Verification and Judgment** – overseeing AI-compiling of information across documents and verifying the synthesized summary before presenting it for approval. | N                                                                       |

**TASK 3 — Course Anchor Proposals**  
Below are suggested anchor use cases (from the list above) for each of the five courses, with the required details:

**Course 1 – Prompting for Outcomes**

*   **course\_id:** `uw_c1_prompting`
*   **Use case:** Explore Copilot 360 Option for the Credit Insurance Program
*   **real\_use\_case:** Explore Copilot 360 Option for the Credit Insurance Program
*   **Rationale:** This use case involves **drafting customer communications and documents using AI**. Underwriters frequently write emails to clients explaining credit decisions and prepare credit memos and proposals (Role Profile, Section 2: Core Responsibilities #5). The scenario from the Credit Insurance team outlines using Copilot to generate email drafts, format text, and tailor documents to client needs. Anchoring the course in this use case will let Underwriters practice crafting effective prompts to get high-quality emails or report content from Copilot, then refine the tone and details – a direct parallel to their day-to-day task of writing **clear, client-friendly credit decision messages**. [\[Complete-L...orized-110 \| Excel\]](https://edcanada-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hhu_edc_ca/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B20AF7CD2-8D31-4881-BC1B-EF8D6683DE6C%7D&file=Complete-List-Categorized-110.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
*   **Suggested title:** *“Writing Credit Recommendations with AI”*

**Course 2 – Verification and Judgment**

*   **course\_id:** `uw_c2_verification`
*   **Use case:** Use Gen-AI to help provide company assessments.
*   **real\_use\_case:** Use Gen-AI to help provide company assessments.
*   **Rationale:** This use case centers on using AI to accelerate **due diligence and credit analysis**, a core part of underwriting (Role Profile, Section 2: Core Responsibilities #2). It emphasizes that underwriters might use AI to gather information on a borrower or buyer (e.g., via internal knowledge base or external data tools) but **must carefully verify** any insights before relying on them. By using this scenario, the course can simulate an Underwriter leveraging Copilot to compile a quick company credit profile or risk summary, and then **practicing the review and fact-checking of that output** against source documents (financial statements, credit reports) to ensure accuracy. This mirrors real-life situations where underwriters double-check every AI-generated analysis for correctness (Role Profile, Section 8: “What must be verified before acting”). [\[Complete-L...orized-110 \| Excel\]](https://edcanada-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hhu_edc_ca/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B20AF7CD2-8D31-4881-BC1B-EF8D6683DE6C%7D&file=Complete-List-Categorized-110.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
*   **Suggested title:** *“Trust but Verify: Validating AI’s Credit Analysis”*

**Course 3 – Data Safety and Compliance**

*   **course\_id:** `uw_c3_data_safety`
*   **Use case:** The main objective of this case is to obtain approval to input internal (i.e., non-public) client data into MS Copilot on the Web to increase work efficiency on the Impact team (FinDev Canada).
*   **real\_use\_case:** The main objective of this case is to obtain approval to input internal (i.e., non-public) client data into MS Copilot on the Web to increase work efficiency on the Impact team (FinDev Canada).
*   **Rationale:** This use case highlights a scenario that closely parallels the challenges Underwriters face with sensitive data. Underwriters handle confidential financial information and must adhere to EDC’s **Responsible AI usage policies**. The scenario – an Impact team member wanting to put non-public client data into Copilot – allows trainees to confront the **temptation to feed sensitive data into AI** for speed, and practice applying EDC’s “public vs. private data” test (Role Profile, Section 7: Data & Information Handling). The course built on this use case will train Underwriters to use AI effectively **without compromising confidentiality** – for example, by abstracting or anonymizing data in prompts, recognizing restricted information, and understanding when to utilize internal tools only (Role Profile, Section 7: Safe AI Use Boundaries).
*   **Suggested title:** *“Safely Harnessing AI with Confidential Data”*

**Course 4 – Tool Fluency (M365 + Copilot)**

*   **course\_id:** `uw_c4_tool_fluency`
*   **Use case:** Record governance - Summarizing Meeting notes and actions (with attendees tagged)
*   **real\_use\_case:** Record governance - Summarizing Meeting notes and actions (with attendees tagged)
*   **Rationale:** This scenario focuses on using Copilot across multiple Microsoft 365 applications in a workflow – a key aspect of tool fluency. Underwriters take part in recurring meetings (deal discussions, credit committee pre-briefs, team pipeline reviews – Role Profile, Section 3) and often need to capture notes and follow-ups. The use case describes Copilot in Teams generating a meeting summary, then using Outlook to email attendees and SharePoint (or CRM) to store the record. For an Underwriter, this translates to **efficiently using Teams’ AI-generated recap and action list**, then editing it and distributing it appropriately. The course can have participants practice invoking Copilot’s meeting recap, then switching to Outlook for email and saving notes in the deal’s record. This builds familiarity with **chaining Copilot outputs through Teams and Outlook** – a realistic scenario that improves productivity (Role Profile, Section 3: freeing up time from manual note-taking and ensuring accurate records for compliance). [\[Complete-L...orized-110 \| Excel\]](https://edcanada-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hhu_edc_ca/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B20AF7CD2-8D31-4881-BC1B-EF8D6683DE6C%7D&file=Complete-List-Categorized-110.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
*   **Suggested title:** *“Mastering Copilot for Meetings and Follow-Ups”*

**Course 5 – Capstone (Integrated Scenario)**

*   **course\_id:** `uw_c5_capstone`
*   **Use case(s):** UW Streamlining; Underwriting Knowledge Assistant; Pricing Benchmark Retrieval
*   **real\_use\_case:** UW Streamlining; Underwriting Knowledge Assistant; Pricing Benchmark Retrieval
*   **Rationale:** This capstone weaves together multiple steps of an Underwriter’s workflow, requiring **all four AI skill domains**. For example, an integrated scenario could have an Underwriter face a tight deadline on a complex deal requiring: (1) **Ingestion and summarization of a lengthy *bank credit report* (UW Streamlining)** – using Copilot to parse and highlight risk flags in a large document, while crafting the right prompt to extract the needed details (Prompting for Outcomes) and then **checking the AI-highlighted issues against the document** to make sure nothing critical was missed (Verification and Judgment). Next, the Underwriter might (2) consult an **Underwriting Knowledge Assistant** to pull up any relevant internal guidelines or past deal insights – requiring them to know which Copilot interface to use (e.g., a Teams bot or SharePoint search) and how to refine the query (Tool Fluency with enterprise data search). Finally, the scenario can include (3) using AI for **Pricing Benchmark Retrieval** – having Copilot search internal databases and public info for comparable deal pricing, then ensuring no restricted information is shared in the prompt (Data Safety and Compliance) and reviewing the suggestions for accuracy (Verification). By combining these steps, the capstone course will test learners on orchestrating multiple Copilot tools in one realistic underwriting case, from initial analysis to final decision prep.
*   **Suggested title:** *“AI in Action: End-to-End Underwriting Simulation”*

**TASK 4 — Gap Check**  
All four AI skill domains are well represented by the selected use cases, so **no domain is left without a suitable training scenario from the library**. Each domain for the Underwriter role has at least one strong use case anchor, meaning we do not need to create a completely new scenario from scratch. (For example, *Tool Fluency* was initially less explicit in the library for Underwriters, but the “Record governance” meeting notes case was identified as a good fit to cover multi-application workflows, eliminating the need for a synthesized use case.)

**All domains covered. No synthesis needed.**
